## The Aragon Network launch
At [AraCon 2019](https://aracon.one), Aragon project co-founder and then-Aragon One CEO Luis Cuende [announced](https://youtu.be/oND8XJ-bvB8?t=389) that the Aragon Network would launch on the Ethereum mainnet by the end of 2019. In September 2019, Aragon project co-founder and then-Aragon One CTO Jorze Izquierdo published his anticipated [timeline](https://forum.aragon.org/t/aragon-network-launch-phases-and-target-dates/1263) for the Aragon Network launch, describing three main phases:

- Phase 1: ANJ launch and Aragon Court deployment
- Phase 2: Aragon Court launch
- Phase 3: Aragon Network DAO

Phase 1 began with the start of [Aragon Network Juror (ANJ) token pre-activation](https://blog.aragon.org/juror-pre-activation-guide/) on January 7, 2020. Phase 2 to began with the [start of the first precedence campaign dispute](https://blog.aragon.org/launching-aragon-court/) on [Fight For Freedom Day](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-12.md) February 10, 2020. Phase 3 is planned to begin when [Aragon Agreements](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-agreements/) is ready for production use by the Aragon Network and other Aragon organizations.

## Aragon Network governance
The Aragon Network is currently governed by a [Governor Council](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-network-deploy/#governor-council), with [plans](https://blog.aragon.org/evolving-aragon-network-governance/) to turn over governance to [Aragon Network Token (ANT)](aragon_network_token.md) holders in Phase 3 of the Aragon Network launch.

## Aragon Network votes
The first vote ever held by the Aragon Network on the Ethereum mainnet was [using the Survey app](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-launches-survey-app-on-mainnet-ed5eefeb66f5/), and started on May 31, 2018. Later that year, ANT holders [voted to approve](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote/) AGP-1: The Aragon Governance Proposal Process. In total there were six votes held under the AGP process defined in AGP-1. On March 13, 2020 ANT holders voted to [approve AGP-155](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-6/), sunsetting the AGP process in preparation for Phase 3 of the Aragon Network launch.
