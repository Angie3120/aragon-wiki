## Lion

- Questions about the current structure of the CLI:
  - Why are ABIs imported inline instead of at the top of the file? _Answer_: To fetch their content ‚Äúon-demand‚Äù.
  - Why the apm parameter contains an ipfs config object? _Answer_: At first, only the apm was using ipfs. It probably should not be nested anymore.
  - Why use ava for tests? _Answer_: Consistency with other Aragon projects.
- Proposed an example of typed variables with jsdoc: https://github.com/dapplion/aragon-cli/blob/d9ab8515fb7ae9c64332d3872abc3daef040c6d1/packages/aragon-cli/src/commands/dao_cmds/acl_cmds/view.js#L49
