# Aragon SDK: Standup 1 notes

Call happening on 24th of October 2019, 1:30 PM CEST

## Intros

Gabi, Ale, Daniel, Matthew

## Retros

### Gabi

- Studying product of view
- Getting consultancy and researching on product
- User based design

### Mathew

- A CLI just for interacting with a DAO, but with all of its features
- Weak code with very little tests
- we need to improve stablity

### Daniel

- Ideas soon
- Interface mixed with the API
- Extracting utilities to a different package
- CLI extensible, ability to add apps
- Language agnostic extensibility
- Wasm?
- Something lower than a CLI client, an API that allows you to use a DAO

### Ale

- CLI client and Web client
- no aragonJS on dev
- Split commnads and scripts
- A lot of code duplication and redundant utilities that could be abstracted to a different library
- Use typescript for static analysis and have more developer adoption? Team agrees, Daniel says yes, but keep only JS for client and frontside

## Next steps

- keybase channel
- 2 standup calls a week

### Ale

- Hands dirty
- aragonJS, how it fetches apps from a DAO, and tx pathing
- Look at other delightful DX: open_zeppelin, create-react-app, ethers

### Gabi

- Reach out devs, even if suboptimal, start getting out there and ask questions in the street
- Reproduce himself the whole workflow and identify pain points
- Improve his own docs to share
- Analytics? Team: reaching out to the little existing devs should be enough - Daniel - Map out concerns of the code

## Short term goal

design a nice API
