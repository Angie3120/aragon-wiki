# Development Plan
_**This documentation is currently outdated and will be updated in Q2 2018**_

version 1.2

<img src="../../images/development_plan/01.png">
</center>

## **Introduction**

Aragon is everything you need to run organizations (companies, NGOs, foundations, open
source projects...) on the Ethereum blockchain. It implements features like a cap table,
token transfers, voting, roles, fundraising and accounting. Aragon organizations are easily
customizable, and they are also extensible by installing third party modules.

Aragon organizations will be able to opt-in into the Aragon Network, which will provide
services like upgradeability and a decentralized court arbitration system for Aragon
organizations.

For more information, please refer to [our website](https://aragon.one) our dapp white paper and our Network
whitepaper.

This document describes how Aragon Dev plans to develop the Aragon dapp, the Aragon
Network and how Aragon Dev is positioned in the larger context of the Aragon project. 

## **History & Vision**
<center>
<img src="../../images/development_plan/02.png" width="50%"><img src="../../images/development_plan/03.png" width="50%">
</center>

Luis and Jorge have been dreaming of a decentralized world for years. They met via Twitter
when they were only 15 years old, and immediately started building products together.

At the age of 17, they prototyped a fully decentralized Internet replacement by using mesh
networks, blockchain technology and protocols like Bluetooth LE and WiFi Direct.

[Stampery](https://stampery.com)—Luis’ latest company—made blockchain timestamping accessible, and has
worked with institutions like the Estonian government, Microsoft and Telefonica. It
participated in TechCrunch Disrupt and was backed by billionaire Tim Draper.

Luis has also been recognized as a [30 Under 30 by Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-europe-2016/technology/#6662a3e4a4b3) and [Innovator Under 35 by the
MIT](http://www.innovatorsunder35.com/innovator/luis-cuende).

Before building Aragon, Luis and Jorge were in Silicon Valley working on solving the problem
of patent trolls with Unpatent. After figuring out how broken the underlying infrastructure of
innovation is—patent trolls thriving, Donald Trump winning the elections, bureaucracy
eating entrepreneurship—they decided to focus all of their time in building the
infrastructure that new companies and organizations will run on top of.

When talking about Aragon, taking a step back and thinking about the why of organizational
structures like companies is a sane move.
Firms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or
provide services.
However, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of
those organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks.
Aragon was born to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies and other
organizational structures.

Luis and Jorge were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper [The
Nature of the Firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm) and Yochai Benkler's [Linux and the Nature of the Firm](http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html). Both explore the
concept of company.

At Aragon Dev, we believe that the blockchain and the Internet are changing the incentives
for companies to exist, and we are building tools for the next generation of companies that
will take advantage of these changes.

However, for decentralized organizations to be widespread, we need to make sure that they
are easy to use, upgradeable/durable and able to resolve human disputes.

We want to solve—either us or partnering with others—those points in order to make
decentralized organizations widespread.

And, thanks to the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network, we can solve those points.

## **Organizational Structure**

<center>
<img src="../../images/development_plan/05.png">
</center>

**Aragon Community**, defining the community members contributing to the dapp and Network
and the Aragon Network Token holders.

**Aragon MTU**, from now on, _**the Foundation**_, a non-profit organization based in Estonia, will
serve as the umbrella organization responsible for allocating resources to other bodies for
future cryptocurrency research and development going forward. The board of the
Foundation consists of Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo. The Foundation will focus on
overarching the mission and will enable operating organizations to accomplish the day-to-
day work.

The Foundation will also serve as a governance entity that will listen the Community until
the Aragon Network is fully operational, from where the full governance of the Network will
be transferred to the ANT holders.

**Aragon Dev**, a for-profit corporation that will be founded after the token sale is finished, and
will serve the Foundation and employ a team that will work on the Aragon platform. It will
also serve as a service provider for the Aragon Network.

**Funding Priorities** It is intended that the Foundation will deploy the revenue from the token
sale as depicted in the Intended Use of Revenue document, but it reserves the right to make
changes if it deems them necessary.

## **Development Milestones**

We will divide development milestones in the form of releases.
Each release may have multiple deployment stages, from being in alpha stage—running on
the test network—to begin in the production stage—running on the main network—going
through multiple testing, security and QA stages.

### 0.1 — The Initial Release
<center>
<img src="../../images/development_plan/06.png">

<center>
<img src="../../images/development_plan/08.png">
</center>
This version added the Bring your own token functionality, that allows using Aragon with any
ERC20 token as a governance token—ERC20 is a token standard allows everyone to
interface with a variety of tokens in a common way. It also added two new bylaws, specific
address only and ask oracle contract for confirmation—stepping stone for more dynamic
bylaws.

It introduced delegate voting and creation of custom, complex stock classes.

It featured new iconography, notable startup time improvements and web browser support
for using it with Ethereum browsers/clients like Mist, Parity, MetaMask, Status etc.
___
<h3>Release Calendar</h3>

- **Alpha**: April 2017

### 0.4 — The Bridge Release
This release will focus on adding:

**Economic abstraction**

Companies will be able to hold and interact with any standard value-holding token

**Improved budgeting and accounting**

Organizations will be in itself the organization's _bank account_.

**Dividends**

Dividend sharing with shareholders, if desired.

**Fundraising tokens**

Company will be able to raise funds in the form of tokens, not necessarily ether. More
flexible founding routes.

**Funds vault**

Final funds vault API, the only part of the company that is not expected to change. This will
make upgradeability easier, being able to redeploy significant parts of the organization while
maintaining its access to the funds.
___
<h3>Release Calendar</h3>

- **Alpha**: July 2017

This will be a development version only focusing on smart contracts, iterating between
different models for upgradeability, extensibility and security. 

 

### 0.5 — The Refactor Release
<center>
<img src="../../images/development_plan/05_release.png">
</center>

This release will consist of a total refactor, and will focus on adding:

**Organization-wide identity**

Entities in organizations will be able to register their own usernames in the organization,
and also provide offchain metadata for displaying purposes in the UI.

**Full upgradeability**

Organizations that will be able to run as long as the Ethereum blockchain runs. No matter if
big chunks of functionality are swapped.

**Totally new permission system**

Extensible permission system to allow any entity to interact with another one using an ACL
(Access Control List) that the kernel controls and maintains.

**Switch to an exokernel architecture**

By making the kernel a very simple contract that just keeps the ACL and keep references to
the installed apps, we can make it more secure and reduce the lines of code and complexity
in apps, since there can be multiple instances of an app, also making upgradeability easier.

**Front-end modules API**

This will let developers build modules for Aragon that extend its functionality.
We will provide an API for developers to access functionality from the Aragon client, and a UI
toolkit for them to adhere to our styling and UX patterns.

**Core modules API**

The API will let the developer trigger actions inside the organization itself, and access more
low-level capabilities.

<img src="../../images/development_plan/10.png">
</center>

This release will focus on adding:

**Organization-wide datastores**

Using a connector for IPFS/Swarm and the Aragon Versioning Protocol, we will provide a
second layer that will give storage capabilities to the dapp. This way, new features and UX
sugar will be able to be added to the organizations. Example: setting a company’s logo, or
implementing an organization-wide identity system, instead of public ones.

**Module developer incentives plan**

We will provide a module store and incorporate an incentives system for developers to be
rewarded.

**Different upgrade tracks**

We will provide different upgrade options.  This is what we are targeting:

### 0.9 — The Unknown Release
<center>
<img src="../../images/development_plan/13.png">
</center>

This is a wildcard release. The ecosystem is evolving very quickly and we don't know what
interesting features we may want to add that will make the 1.0 release more appealing.

Some ideas of what we might work on here:

**Privacy-focused companies**

_**zkSnarks**_ could provide companies with way more privacy. Private voting and ownership are
very interesting concepts we are researching about.

**Different governance mechanisms**

Until now Aragon companies and the Network will be simple liquid democracy based
entities.  

We are closely following research and experimentation on other governance mechanisms
such as **Futarchy**.

### 1.0 — The Release
<center>
<img src="../../images/development_plan/14.png">
</center>

We expect to start marketing Aragon to the mainstream with this release. To achieve that
mission, we will have to place an important focus on design and user experience.
